            <div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    We are living through a profound transformation in how work gets done. For generations, our education system and professional culture have taught us to <strong>focus on delivering work by ourselves</strong>—to be the expert, to solve problems independently, to prove our individual capability. This approach has created countless successful professionals.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    But the rise of AI and machine learning is fundamentally changing this paradigm. We're moving from a world where success means <strong>doing the work</strong> to one where success means <strong>building robots that can do the work</strong>. This isn't just a technological shift—it's a cultural transformation that challenges everything we learned in school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The question is: Are you adapting to this new reality, or are you still operating with the old mindset?

            <h2 class="section-title">🎯 Doing the Work: The Traditional Approach</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">The culture we learned in school—focused on individual achievement and personal delivery</p>
            
            <div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 2rem auto 2rem; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    The traditional approach to professional work is deeply ingrained in us from our school days. We were taught to study hard, pass exams individually, and prove our worth through personal achievement. In the workplace, this translates to:

                    <p>Continuous learning through lunch-and-learn sessions where team members share knowledge over sandwiches. While valuable, this approach requires constant scheduling, attendance, and repetition for new team members.</p>

                    <h3>Constant Team Pressure</h3>
                    <p>Maintaining velocity through direct team effort. Every sprint, every story point, every deliverable requires active human involvement. Taking time off or team changes create immediate bottlenecks.</p>

                    <h3>Individual Expertise</h3>
                    <p>Success depends on accumulating personal knowledge and skills. You become valuable by being the expert, the go-to person, the one who knows how things work. This creates dependencies and knowledge silos.</p>

                    <h3>Repetitive Knowledge Transfer</h3>
                    <p>Every new team member requires manual onboarding. Every question gets answered individually. Every problem solved today might need to be solved again tomorrow by someone else.</p>

                    <h3>Linear Scaling</h3>
                    <p>To deliver more, you need more people. Growth means hiring, training, and managing larger teams. Your capacity is directly tied to headcount and hours worked.</p>

                    <h3>School Culture Mindset</h3>
                    <p>The underlying belief is that success comes from your personal ability to deliver. This is what we learned throughout our education—individual achievement, personal responsibility, self-reliance.</p>

                    This approach isn't wrong—it's just becoming insufficient in a world where AI can automate routine work and amplify human capabilities exponentially.

                    <p>Instead of just doing the work, you're teaching AI agents to understand patterns, make decisions, and execute tasks. Your value shifts from being the doer to being the trainer and architect of intelligent systems.</p>

                    <p>AI agents break down organizational boundaries. Knowledge that was locked in individual teams or specialists becomes accessible enterprise-wide. The whole organization becomes smarter together.</p>

                    <h3>Collaborative Approach</h3>
                    <p>Success is no longer about what you can deliver alone, but about what you can enable systems to deliver. It's collaborative by nature—you work with AI, your team works with AI, and AI agents collaborate across teams.</p>

                    <p>Once an AI agent learns something, that knowledge is instantly available to everyone. Training one agent improves capability across the entire organization. Scale becomes decoupled from headcount.</p>
