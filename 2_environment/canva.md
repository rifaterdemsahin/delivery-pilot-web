# Canva for Workshops and Simulations

This document outlines how we utilize Canva to facilitate interactive workshops and realistic simulations.

## Workshops

We use Canva's collaborative features to run engaging and productive workshops. Key activities include:

*   **Visual Whiteboarding:** utilizing Canva's infinite whiteboard for brainstorming, mind mapping, and organizing ideas in real-time.
*   **Template Utilization:** Leveraging pre-built templates for activities like Delivery Pilot Methodology, Vibe Programming, and empathy mapping to save time and ensure delivery on delivery pilot projects.
*   **Collaborative Design:** allowing multiple participants to edit and contribute to visual artifacts simultaneously, fostering a sense of ownership and teamwork and participation in assesment in the simulation for continuous improvement.
*   **Presentation Integration:** Seamlessly switching between workshop activities and presentation slides to maintain flow and context for the agent building process.

## Simulations

In our simulations, Canva plays a crucial role in creating immersive and realistic environments.

*   **Asset Creation:** Designing custom agents such for enterprise use cases.
*   **Scenario Visualization:** Creating visual storyboards or flowcharts to map out the progression of simulation scenarios and decision points.
*   **Role-Playing Aids:** Using the multi role model, in an x shaped skills  we use character cards, background dossiers, and other visual aids to help participants step into their assigned roles.
*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly mocking up UI concepts or digital products to test assumptions and gather feedback during simulation debriefs in github which would me ported to onpremise.
