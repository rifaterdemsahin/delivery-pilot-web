# Customer Creation Stage Formula

This formula outlines the strategic process of "creating" customers by transforming prosumers into internal champions and partners who ultimately unlock enterprise opportunities. This aligns with the Delivery Pilot "Partner-Prosumer Formula".

## 🎯 Strategic Overview

**"We don't just find customers; we create them."**

The goal is to build a sales force we don't have to hire. We convert **Prosumers** (professional consumers) into **Partners** who then sell Delivery Pilot services to **Enterprises**.

## 🔄 The Creation Lifecycle

The customer creation process mirrors the [Onboarding Stages](../5_Symbols/onboarding.html) but viewed through a strategic growth lens.

### Phase 1: Attract & Assess (The Prosumer)
*Maps to Onboarding Stage 1: Assessment*

**Activities:**
- **Content Engine**: Weekly YouTube videos and LinkedIn thought leadership to attract interest.
- **Free Assessment**: 1-1 confidential sessions to assess AI readiness and skill gaps.
- **Value Proposition**: "Where do you stand in the AI race?"

**Goal:** Build a pool of qualified prosumers and establish trust.
**Metric:** Assessment Completions.

### Phase 2: Train & Simulate (The Apprentice)
*Maps to Onboarding Stage 2: Workshops*

**Activities:**
- **Simulations**: 2-8 hour hands-on workshops (online or onsite).
- **Curriculum**: Top 10 AI Courses (Vibe Programming, RAG, XAI, etc.).
- **Product**: Participants build actual working agents, not just theories.

**Goal:** Equip prosumers with "Delivery Pilot" methodology and proofs-of-concept.
**Metric:** Workshop Certifications / "Agent Fixer" capability.

### Phase 3: Partner & Penetrate (The Partner)
*Maps to Onboarding Stage 3: Express*

**Activities:**
- **Internal Advocacy**: The trained prosumer (now an employee/contractor at an enterprise) identifies "Time Borrowing" opportunities.
- **Express Implementation**: Merging the "Vibe" world with Enterprise requirements.
- **Revenue Share**: Partners earn commission for unlocking enterprise workshops and implementations.

**Goal:** Unlock Enterprise budgets and recurring revenue through internal advocates.
**Metric:** Enterprise Contracts / Recurring Revenue.

## 📊 Success Indicators

| Stage | Indicator | Target |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Creation** | New Prosumers (Assessments) | 1,000/year |
| **Conversion** | Workshop Participants | 500/year |
| **Partnership** | Active Partners (Selling) | 25/year |
| **Enterprise** | Recurring Contracts | 50+ |
