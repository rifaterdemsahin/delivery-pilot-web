**Reality Check:**
- ⚠️ No evidence these numbers have been achieved
- ⚠️ Conversion rates unknown
- ⚠️ Customer acquisition cost (CAC) unknown
- ⚠️ Churn rate unknown

### 8.2 Cost Structure (Estimated)

**Fixed Costs:**
- Website/hosting: $1,000/year
- Software/tools: $5,000/year
- Insurance: $2,000/year
- Professional development: $5,000/year
- Marketing: $10,000-50,000/year
- **Total Fixed:** $23,000-63,000/year

**Variable Costs:**
- Travel (workshops): $500-1,000 per workshop
- Sales commissions: 0% (direct sales)
- Contractor fees: TBD (if used)

**Gross Margin:** 60-80% (service business typical)

### 8.3 Unit Economics (Theoretical)

| Product | Price | Delivery Cost | Gross Profit | Margin |
|---------|-------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Prosumer | $50 | $25-50 (1 hr) | $0-25 | 0-50% |
| Workshop | £2,500 | £500-1,000 (travel, time) | £1,500-2,000 | 60-80% |
| Enterprise | £25,000 | £5,000-10,000 | £15,000-20,000 | 60-80% |

**Critical Concerns:**
- Prosumer assessment may be unprofitable (lead gen cost)
- Margins deteriorate with scale (need to hire delivery resources)
- No validation of these numbers with actual customer data

### 8.4 Financial Health Grade: D (Incomplete Data)

**Cannot Assess:**
- Actual revenue (no historical data shared)
- Profitability
- Cash flow
- Runway
- Break-even point

**Recommendation:** Implement financial tracking immediately
