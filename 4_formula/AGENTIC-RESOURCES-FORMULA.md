# Agentic Resources Creation Formula

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Don't Be a Robot.** If you are doing repetitive tasks that an agent could do, you are wasting human potential.

## 1. The Core Philosophy
The goal is to shift from "humans doing the work" to "humans building the agents that do the work".
- **Humans**: Creative, strategic, non-linear thinking.
- **Agents**: Repetitive, precise, 24/7 availability.

## 2. Identifying Candidates for Agentification
Look for tasks with these characteristics:
- **Repetitive**: Done daily, weekly, or monthly with little variation.
- **Time-Consuming**: Takes more than 15 minutes of purely mechanical work.
  - *Example*: Sending a daily report that takes 2 hours to compile.
- **Undocumented**: Knowledge lives in one person's head.
  - *Risk*: If that person leaves, the capability leaves with them.

## 3. The Creation Process (The Formula)

### Step 1: Capture the Workflow
Before you can build an agent, you must understand the task.
- **Record**: Screen record the human doing the task.
- **Document**: Write down the decision points (if X, then Y).
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Define exactly what data comes in and what report goes out.

### Step 2: Build the Agent
Use the Delivery Pilot platform to create the agent.
- **Context**: Feed the agent the documentation and rules.
- **Tools**: Give the agent access to necessary APIs or data sources.
- **Prompting**: Design the instructions to replicate the human's quality standards.

### Step 3: Verification & Human-in-the-Loop
- **Test**: Run the agent parallel to the human for a week.
- **Review**: The human reviews the agent's work (e.g., the 2-hour report is now generated in seconds, human spends 10 mins reviewing).

### Step 4: Enterprise Capability Investment
- **Documentation**: The agent's code and prompt *become* the living documentation.
- **Resilience**: If the human leaves, the agent remains. The capability is now an asset of the enterprise, not just the employee.

## 4. Why Invest?
- ** Responsiveness**: Agents don't sleep. Reports can be sent at 2 AM or on weekends if needed.
- **Retention**: Employees burnout from being "robots". Removing repetitive tasks improves job satisfaction.
- **Knowledge Preservation**: "Resources with no documentation leave." Agents capture that knowledge permanently.
