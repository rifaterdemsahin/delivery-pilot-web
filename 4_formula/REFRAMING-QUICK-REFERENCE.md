## Process Model Reframing

### The 3-Stage Journey

| Stage | OLD Name & Focus ❌ | NEW Name & Focus ✅ |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Stage 1** | **Assessment** - Identify skills gaps, training needs | **Discovery & Cognitive Mapping** - Map delivery complexity, identify high-cognitive-load tasks |
| **Stage 2** | **Workshops** - One-to-many training on AI topics | **Agent Development Sprints** - Build purpose-built agents for specific delivery problems |
| **Stage 3** | **Express** - Git-based learning outputs | **Production Integration** - Deploy agents into practitioner workflows, measure velocity impact |

---

## Success Metrics Reframing

### What We Measure

| Metric Category | OLD Metric ❌ | NEW Metric ✅ |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Primary KPI** | Number of people trained | Delivery velocity increase (deployments/week) |
| **Quality** | Skills test scores | MTTR reduction (mean time to resolution) |
| **ROI** | Employee satisfaction with training | Headcount efficiency (output per engineer) |
| **Outcome** | Knowledge acquired | Infrastructure reliability (SLA/SLO adherence) |
| **Scale** | Training completion rate | Agent adoption across organization |

---

## Use Case Examples (Always Use Infrastructure Context)

### ✅ GOOD Examples (Agent + Infrastructure)
1. **Kubernetes Diagnostic Agent**  
   "Augments SRE teams managing 100+ Kubernetes clusters—correlates pod failures with recent config changes, reducing MTTR by 40%"

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Intelligence Agent**  
   "Analyzes 10,000+ line build logs in seconds, identifies root cause of pipeline failures—makes DevOps engineers 10x faster at troubleshooting"

3. **Cloud Cost Optimization Agent**  
   "Monitors AWS/Azure/GCP spend patterns, identifies anomalies, recommends rightsizing—avoids hiring dedicated FinOps engineer"

4. **Incident Response Agent**  
   "Assists on-call SREs by surfacing similar past incidents and proven resolutions—reduces junior engineer ramp time by 6 months"

### ❌ BAD Examples (Generic Training)
1. "Learn prompt engineering in our interactive course"
2. "Upskill your team on AI fundamentals"
3. "Workshop on ChatGPT best practices"
4. "Training program for AI ethics and compliance"

---

## Competitive Positioning

### OLD Competitors ❌ (Education Market)
- Coursera
- Udemy  
- LinkedIn Learning
- Linux Foundation Training
- Cloud provider training (AWS Training, Azure Learn)

### NEW Competitors ✅ (Infrastructure/Tooling Market)
- **Datadog / New Relic** - Observability + AI features
- **HashiCorp** - Infrastructure automation (Terraform, Vault)
- **Humanitec / Port** - Internal developer platforms
- **PagerDuty** - Incident management + AI
- **Custom internal tooling teams**

### Differentiator
"Purpose-built agents that embed into practitioner workflows—not generic monitoring dashboards or one-size-fits-all platforms. We codify your experts' knowledge into agents that scale infinitely."

---

## Pricing & ROI Framing

### OLD Framing ❌ (Training Cost)
- "Affordable workshops starting at £500/day"
- "Invest in your team's AI skills"
- "Training budget optimization"
- "Cost per learner: $50"

### NEW Framing ✅ (Infrastructure Investment)
- "Agent development sprints starting at £2,500"
- "Avoid hiring 3-5 additional senior engineers (£200k+/year)"
- "Infrastructure tooling investment, not training cost"
- "Cognitive infrastructure that scales infinitely vs. human capacity"

### ROI Calculation Template
```
Hiring 2 Senior Kubernetes Engineers:
- Salary: £160k/year (£80k each)
- Benefits: £40k/year
- Ramp time: 6 months
- Total Year 1: £200k
- Scalability: Still limited by human cognitive capacity

Kubernetes Cognitive Agents:
- Development: £50k one-time
- Annual refinement: £10k/year
- Deployment: 60 days
- Total Year 1: £60k
- Scalability: Every engineer gets expert-level support
- Impact: Existing team becomes 10x more effective

Savings: £140k Year 1, £190k/year ongoing
```

## Stakeholder Communication Template

### Email to Existing Prospects
```
Subject: Delivery Pilot Positioning Update—What We've Always Built

Hi [Name],

Quick update: We've refined how we communicate what Delivery Pilot does.

The reality: We've always built purpose-built AI agents that augment platform teams. 
Our agents help DevOps/SRE teams manage Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure, and CI/CD 
complexity—making senior engineers 10x more effective.

What's changing: Our website and messaging now match what we actually deliver.
What's NOT changing: Our product, service quality, or commitment to your success.

Why this matters to you: 
- Clearer ROI (compare to hiring costs, not training budget)
- Better positioning internally (infrastructure tooling, not L&D)
- Accurate competitive framing (vs. Datadog/tooling, not Coursera)

Happy to discuss how this impacts our engagement. Nothing changes operationally—
just clearer communication of the value we deliver.

Best,
[Your Name]
```
