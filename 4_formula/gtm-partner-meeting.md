# Five Bullet Points for the Interview

Based on the conversation, here are the key topics to cover:

## 1. **The AI Skills Gap Crisis (RACE - Rapid AI Increases Skills Expectations)**
- How technology is moving at 10X speed while professionals struggle to keep up
- The gap between what CEOs/CTOs need and what their teams can deliver
- Why traditional approaches (waterfall, agile) are being disrupted by AI-powered workflows

## 2. **AI Agents vs. Automation: Understanding the Difference**
- Agents make decisions independently (like a robot that decides when dishes are dirty and loads the dishwasher)
- Automation just executes tasks (the dishwasher itself)
- Real-world examples: tax agents, content creation agents, Teams message analysis agents

## 3. **Building Your Business on an Agentic Framework from Day One**
- How Erdem uses AI agents in his own small business (taxes, promotion, time management, website, lead collection)
- The competitive advantage of starting with agentic systems as the core skeleton
- Reducing barriers to entry for new founders and solo entrepreneurs

## 4. **The Assessment-to-Simulation Journey**
- Self-assessment tool: Where are you in the AI journey?
- Free YouTube resources and workshops for hands-on learning
- Why simulation and practice are essential (not just theory)

## 5. **The Future of Work: 10X More Jobs, Not Fewer**
- Why displacement fears miss the bigger picture (like horses to cars)
- New roles that will emerge: building agents, training agents, maintaining agents, fixing agents
- The importance of local support for AI systems (Cambridge vs. China example)

---

# meeting transcript
Can you guys hear me properly?

(...)

Yes,(...) I will make the screen a bit bigger so I should be a little bit bigger on the frame. Once there are three people I can also change the location as well. How are you Alden?

(...)

I'm very well thank you. How are you? Good, very good.

(...)

I'm trying to balance multiple things at the same time. Mariana knows I'm doing...

(...)

I failed by creating so many problems until I may have been there in my own life daily sometimes. Yes, yes. So I'm trying to raise two kids, supporting my partner and yes it is. It's something though. When are we going to start? Did we start?

(...)

So we're not recording? We are not interviewing today.(...) Today we are doing an introduction call. We will talk about as well how we can help you and your goals. Because we want to make that interview useful for you because that interview aims to promote you as an expert in a subject.

(...)

It's important to talk as well about your main business goal, who is your audience to whom we are talking and based on that Alden will polish five main topics that he will talk to you about next. The first thing I'd like to do for these interviews is first we have a little chat like this one where we talk about what's the subject, what's the general theme of the conversation.(...) And then you'll send you an email with a little bit of practicality about how we're going to do things. And I'll ask you to get back to me with about five bullet points.

(...)

And then that gives me the information so that when we run the interview itself, I kind of know what I want to give you space to talk about. And my role is to be like the voice of the audience. Alright.

I think that that quite nicely covers a lot of SMEs, but it disrupts its innovative SMEs. It's SMEs that are scaling to a front-end to do something new into the world, but not talking addresses.

(...)

Okay?(...) So the reason why we're targeting that market, and we need to be a little bit consistent about the content because that's what's gonna draw the audience in and keep them watching.

(...)

The reason why we're targeting that market is because on your first journey as a founder, there is so much that you need to know, and nobody comes into a business knowing all of it.

(...)

So these are people with expertise gaps, and those expertise gaps of where their business is going to struggle. So on the one hand, the demand for content to kind of help them see the problem that they're dealing with and understand the factors that lie behind it. So the demand for content is very strong.

(...)

And on the other hand, those are the people who, if they're smart, will be reaching out to consultants and experts and going,(...) I need to get over this gap. I can't afford to hire someone full-time to build the problem, but also my business is not going to thrive until I brought in the expertise that can help me fix this particular problem, whatever it happens to be.

(...)

There's so many different issues that a business is going to run into along its journey.(...) Yes, from what I understood this, we did talk about this a little bit with Mariana.

(...)

The number of small businesses in the world are increasing. You guys are helping with this go-to-market strategies for companies, for people, individuals who did not do this before is your focus, I guess, or people who are in the transition of doing this, like myself, are in the-- We have, like you, I'm balancing several different things. So on the one hand, I'm acting as a consultant, helping small businesses with their go-to-market strategy, business vision, this kind of thing. That's my core expertise as a provider, but as value--

You get into the details of it and you need to give as much of your expertise as you can. Because the more you educate the audience about your expertise, the more they'll see your mastery of the subject and think, "Okay, that's what I need." And the more likely they are to reach out to you. That's very much the principle that we work through. The first moment, Adam, you have the worst of it a bit. Your face is blue. My face is the autofocus is not working properly, I guess. That's the problem.(...) Now it's better?

(...)

No, this is...

(...)

Yes, it is AFC autofocus continuous. So I think there's a problem there, though, because I'm normally shooting it stand up.

(...)

I probably need to do a fine-tuning in the internal auto-manual autofocus. But this is AFC, but there is multiple focuses on the camera.

(...)

We are not really so very we're very close.(...) I feel that when you're in that late series 8 stage you're probably 50 to 100 people.

What we're trying to do is build a platform that can connect up founders and small businesses with all of the different experts that they need. And that's the hat that I'm wearing today.(...) And for you, Erdem, that platform, and all by itself, it's an opportunity to get a right client in a short way.(...) Do you understand? And what we want to do, we want to interview you in the way that you are showing your expertise. Because as I understand, if I understand correctly, your main client is not a... You would like to work to be... Who is your main client? My main client is enterprises. The way that I enter to their enterprise is the prosumers, the professionals that works indoors, in those enterprises. So what's happening right now is in the last 30 years, there was a waterfall revolution, then an agile revolution in software development lifecycle with all these tech companies. And what happened in the last 10 years is most of the companies realize they are tech companies. They are not just companies, but they are producing technology. Right now, with the rise of the AI, what's happening is there is a new transformation happening from the agile way of working, hiring people, putting them into the scrum, into the AI world, where people are transforming their enterprises with agents, with robots and artificial intelligence to be able to do the work. My customers are who wants to be able to leverage these agents, but my main point is there is something called race. Rapid AI increases skills expectations. Everybody is building with AI right now. It took Instagram two years to reach 100 million users, chat GPT only two months to reach 100 million users. So there is a big gap.(...) The technology is moving at a 10X speed. What is the problem with the CEOs, the CTOs and the CEOs? They are seeing this technology is moving very, very fast, and they understand they are unable to...

to catch up with their skills. So what I do, it is for the prosumers, I assess them, where they are, take them into a simulation, so they will be understand what are these new AI technologies that is coming up, and there's going to be new roles that are gonna get built, which people call them agentic frameworks, I call them building agents.(...) Mariano called it delivery pilot, it stick with me to delivery pilot name, and I kept on using that name, the delivery pilot, because at the end of today, the companies are focused on delivering products for their customers, I help them to be able to deliver these, not just with people, but using agents to be able to do that. As an example, for a small business, I was using tax assist in Cambridge, right now I'm building a AI agent to do my taxes. In the past, I was going through

(...)

steel blank like startup ideas to be able to do my startup, right now I'm building an agent to be able to help me in the startup process. If this is a big enterprise, there's hundreds of channels, I work in IBM right now, so moving to Capgemini, in our enterprise, there's more than 400 teams channels. Their problem is, nobody can read those 400 channels and be able to set the roadmap, but a computer, an agent will be able to read it, will be able to create reports around it, and will be able to guide the delivery in the system. So my end goal is build the agents to be able to address the problem of the race, meaning you are never going to be able to solve the problems without robots. I will give you the robots, the agents, to be able to sort them out, and there's going to be new jobs coming in. So what we are saying is we are creating these new cars, and there's going to be new jobs around these new cars, so everybody will be able to enjoy these new jobs. We are creating those new jobs by building those agents.

(...)

So...

(...)

But, and, Odin, I want to tell more, because he's doing much more than this.(...) Odin, you are creating a content for different audience, for employees,

(...)

So the market that I'm trying to reach with Value Link Pro is early stage founders,(...) but I think a discussion with you about what can you build out of genetic systems to cover? How would you do that? Where are the limitations of it? Where is it most effectively? And if you're building a business from scratch with AI as the framework of the business,(...) what do you think about when you're doing that? I think that would be really interesting to the audience I'm trying to reach. I don't know if that's a conversation that you would like to have and for us to promote. Yes, I can definitely do that. The reason is for myself, I'm also a small business and I have a problem of paying taxes. I have a problem of promoting myself. I have a problem of managing my time. I have a problem of building a website. I have a problem of collecting leads. I have a problem of converting them because I'm myself a small business. But my target business at the end of today is those big enterprises who are going to create the new jobs, the unknown jobs in the world. But we can definitely focus on what you are saying.(...) Can we go from something smaller, Adam? Can we start from something smaller and go into that direction? If we can talk about how you've used AI agents to create, to make your business effective and to spend more time doing what's valuable to you and less time in the overheads of running and operating a business, that would be really interesting. That would be fantastic. You can share how you personally use that in your business.(...) Yes, I can. I can definitely do that because I'm doing it day in and day out. So I can definitely do that. And the number of the viewers will be much higher because the enterprise world is very, very small. And I also realized it in my end. So that is why I started with the prosumers, not with the enterprise end users, because the prosumers, their main problem is the professionals or the small businesses.

of those companies. Yes, they are called Procemors. I first target the Procemors who are directly getting affected by this increasing technology. They are unable to do what their enterprise CTOs, the managers are saying, because the complex is increasing. First, I'm assessing them and giving that assessment on my YouTube channel so they understand where they are in this AI race. So they understand where they are. I take them through workshops. I'm selling them around 500 pounds a day. I did sold this month, all December. They are coming into the workshops. I show them what their gaps are in the initial assessment, show them how they can build agents. At the end of the milestones in those agents, they will be able to build an agent that will be able to complement what they are doing. If they need to read those Teams messages, an agent will be built to be able to do those jobs, such as if I'm marketing to you guys, you guys need to build videos. We create an agent to help you guys build videos. If you guys want to build LinkedIn following, like myself, I will build an agent for you guys so you guys can build the LinkedIn following. So that agent is the robot that does the job with you guys and that enables you to be able to enter into this AI base. The difference between an agent and an automation, it most of the time gets confused. The agent is the robot that makes the dishwasher, the cleaning machine and the cooking done that connects. It's not an automation. It's not just a machine. It makes decisions by itself.

(...)

It's able to do, it has agents in it. So that's why people all over the world is calling them agents. I called it delivery pilot, but the end product is the agents that the enterprises are getting. The reason it's called delivery product is I most of the time work in telcos. Telcos are the companies that survive in the recessions, electricity, telecom. So they need most of the delivery needs. So their problems are obvious and they will be in the good economy as well as bad economy. So I'm trying.

to market the product starting with those operators so they are not bounded by cash and the economic factors that much they need to constantly deliver. So that's why one of the reasons I kept the name and kept the system and I'm working in IBM Capgemini, those companies, they work for operators where they need these agents more than anyone. For example, it takes(...) Royce Royce to create a small nuclear reactor one year to build and operate in the UK. It takes UK government 10 years to take it online. So no company will create a nuclear reactor in one year and wait for nine years to get paid. So these operators have all these red tape around it so they need to deliver. My main goal is go and work for them, create the product in the background as a solar entrepreneur, build agents and once it is the time they were able to catch up, they are going to move from this agile world to robotics and AI based world. The content will be ready, the audience will be ready and I will be traveling around the globe and from time to time come to Cambridge. That is the main goal.(...) So the change in the world that I see coming(...) is as these agentic AI systems come into existing established enterprises,(...) it is going to displace people and it is going to displace often quite skilled and experienced people.

(...)

And the other thing that it does is it reduces massively the barrier to starting up and creating a new business.(...) So you have got people who understand a lot about the problems of the world, have a lot of experience of how to solve problems,(...) trying to looking to set up businesses and then looking for the agentic structure they can use to do so quickly.(...) And those businesses that come in with kind of agentic systems as the core skeleton that the business is built on(...) are going to out-compete businesses that don't have that technology.

Assess themselves. They don't know where they are in this AI world so I created an assessment for them to be able to do this and also a simulations for them so they can understand how they are going to build these agents we can

(...)

create Podcasts around it. I'm okay with that. I'm definitely directed. That would be super. Yeah and plus

(...)

When I do the when I edit the videos, I don't know if you've seen some of the ones we've published before They are getting better They are getting better Expect to go from zero to expert in one step. So I learned something every time. Yes(...) I'm very Spending all the money that I have on video production. I live in CB1 feel free to come over I have a studio if you are interested on learning those as well as on post production. I work with Coursera They just bought the udemy. They are the world's biggest producers right now You will get lots of this a very deep field. The video production is a very very deep field for me Technology is like 10 heart the video production is thousand heart The technology is the easy piece the video production being able to right now look into the camera I have the correct eye level have the back like the lights the audio doing it properly talk about the Correct subject and tell a story at the same time and I'm trying to make comedy. I'm trying to not sell on the

(...)

Boring enterprise stuff. I'm trying to do comedy. I'm unable to do it right now. I get freeze in front of the camera(...) That's a big challenge. If you guys are interested. I really want to Mariana Alden and David people in Cambridge there's Andres and couple of guys also doing video production if there is a Community I think there is a lot we can share and learn on video production Because we did this talk with Mariana. There was like 50 people that came to Bradmore Center But the YouTube has a potential to reach many many more people if we are able to

package this properly.(...) Yes, absolutely. As well,(...) Alden, we didn't say about the education program as well that we are going to promote on our platform and to get deeper. It means that if you will be able to have a-- you are able-- you can do it definitely. But if you would like it, then we can go deeper and develop a content for those founders of startups and SMEs. And you can develop a program, what you are doing very good, and you are an expert in that. I can create-- Do you understand what I mean? I can create some content around these agents and related to you guys that could be useful for me to promote. It will be like your promotion,(...) practical promotion. The thing that I was particularly interested in was that you mentioned a self-assessment checklist. Yes.

(...)

So one of the things that I'd really like to-- as Mariana said, what we're looking to do is develop not just the YouTube content, but also to have a platform so that as an early stage founder, you can quickly navigate through to where you've got pain points. And we can have it multiply linked. So you search about AI. You end up with your content. You search about efficiency. You end up with your content. You search about how do I scale my business within this footprint of running costs that I've got. You end up with your content. So we can link to it from various different places. And what I'd love to have is some videos with experts like yourself that illustrate principles and then supporting material, tools,(...) frameworks,(...) systems that you can go, oh, right, I'm just going to fill in this form. And you go, right, now I know the agents that I need. And also, that's a lovely way for the founder to go, what I need is somebody to come in and help me build the agents that I need. And the form was created by-- Ed M is obviously the right person for me to be bringing in to do this.(...) So these kind of documents, I think, are great sales. (Audio Out)

tools for you, but they're also very valuable materials for the audience that we're trying to reach. And that's the vision that we're building towards. So what I did was I created the assessment. They can take the assessment. They will get an email and a PDF report on their AI, where they are in this AI journey. My roadmap is I give the assessment. I invite them to simulations where they can use hands-on with the instructor who is participating in it. I sold workshops this weekend. I'm selling it for an eight-hour workshop. People come in and do. So that's my gateway to come in and pitch the enterprise, telling them they want an AI transformation. We can take these workshops, start converting them to the agents. That's my workflow. But if we just focus on the prosumer, what is important for them is being able to do the assessment and entering into that simulation. Because as you said, people are getting displaced and they are afraid. And I will hold their hand and take them to a simulation because the future is for the people who will be able to survive in the simulation. It is a negative keyword, I guess, right now, a little bit, being in a simulation, not being in the real world. But the reality is right now, my head is bigger than Mariana's head. And your position is different. So we are three different sets in this simulation. This is a simulation. It's a simulated Google meets environment that we make. If we are able to simulate this better, create a better video, it will be easier for people to be able to digest it. In my simulations, they will be able to use the AI and build agents inside the simulation. I'm trying to invite them to the simulation. What I could do is for you guys, I could give free simulations, free workshops for them so they can come in and we can assign some of today's. I might not do eight hours, but I could do two hours, workshops for them, so they will be able to come in and get their hands on. I don't think without a workshop or a simulation, the link will be...

be broken, you still need a human being to be able to operate these robots. People think always the James Cameron's 30-year-old terminator. The future is not like that. My future that I'm pitching, that I pitched on Cambridge,(...) Bradmore on the Science Center, there will be 10 times more jobs that are going to get created. And I'm willing to create them.

(...)

That is the important part. I'm saying we are going to create 10 times more jobs, but people are afraid I'm going to lose my old coding job. I'm going to lose my old testing job. I'm going to lose my old startup coaching job. I'm going to lose X job. They are not focusing on-- they are focusing on-- there was horses. They will lose the horse. They will lose the horse rider, horse shit cleaner, horse dead by the carrier. Yes, they are going to go, but there will be different jobs-- cars, roads, traffic lights,(...) industry around it. I'm there to create that. So I'm trying to put them into the solution. The world is not short of problems that urgently need to be solved.

(...)

It is short of solutions solving all of these problems. So the more efficiency we create,(...) the faster and easier it is to found a new business to solve this problem that nobody else in the world is solving.

(...)

And we can make the world a better place by doing that. So I think I see and very much share your vision, but it all depends on people being able to use these new tools effectively.(...) And as I said, businesses, as they scale and grow,(...) building on top of a framework of effective automation where that includes agentic AI supporting human beings in solving problems. Yes.(...) For that, I created the YouTube channel and my initial target is not the enterprises, but the prosumers, how to use LinkedIn, how to create content using these AI, how to build a second brain. They are not getting that much attraction right now. Either my video quality is low or I'm too stuck in front of the camera. There is XYZ.

Reason it is there. It's not doing it is doing much better than the five years ago It is maybe doing better than your channel, but I see that there is a one 2000 ratio on YouTube like you create one video if you are able to get 1000 subscribers that is my factor right now. I am at 133 I create one video I'm only able to get 33 subscribers I'm also focusing on those big pragmatist majority where the Consumers are that market that you are talking about I know that they cannot pay the agents but they can definitely come in and do the assessments Attend to the workshops and say I am willing to do this new job, which they don't know

(...)

Can I just quickly for kind of getting the business model straight in my own head? What's the ballpark for creating? Let's say a tax agent you were saying you're creating an agent to do your own taxes What's the ballpark for? That so we need to understand the tax agent and a tax automation if you use tax Assist or QuickBooks, that's a tax automation Yeah, so what do I mean is I'm never ever gonna build a(...) Refrigerator I'm not gonna build a dishwasher. Those are already done. I will build a robot That is going to load to the dishwasher That is going to take the stuff from the dishwasher and put it to the shelves This is what the agents are for they make the decision the plates are dirty put them there So for the business model For the prosumers is free. So I am giving it to them free. I'm not charging them I'm telling them how to do it on YouTube So they can come in watch the video understand take all the content and be able to go and apply it So that part is free, but the assessment part there is a $50 fee, but the assessment part I'm assessing them one-to-one. I am not just giving them a form and doing it If they are unable to go to come by Gemini cloth all these tools that they need

You can be a contractor, but they will not treat you as a business partner at this stage. They cannot, they cannot, just cannot. What I'm doing is I'm finding partners such as this weekend. I sold it with a partner.

(...)

So the partner is selling it, doing all the necessary details on sales and on the borrowing of the time for the enterprises. I'm spending the time and packaging the product with the partner. Again, again, you probably you, I don't know what Alden will tell a second ago or later.(...) Again, you should understand that if you are a solo, even a solo entrepreneur or a company of one, then never a big enterprise can buy something from you. You should be bigger as well, or they can work with you as a contractor, but it's not a business service. They can hire you as a contractor. It's a technical business cooperation last year. Alden, what do you think Radje?

(...)

I think it can be done, but it's very difficult. And the bigger concern that I always have about selling to enterprise is the sales cycles are so long.

(...)

Like the problem is if you're a single person at the end of that sales cycle, there's a limit to how much money you can make from them because there's a limit to how much labor you can provide. But they will not spoil you with money. Definitely. They will make you struggle even if you get. Firstly, they've got all the leverage and they're not used to paying for anything. And secondly, you work on a sales. Your sales costs are huge because you spend six months trying to make the sale. And then at the end of it, the amount of money that you can make from it is constrained by the size of your business. I completely agree on that. So that's why I'm using the partners. Yeah, exactly. I'm in this business for the last 20 years. So the I see.

that the partner needs to take on the sales and the borrowing of the enterprises time, where I develop the product and spend the time on it. I completely understand that. But what's happening right now in the world is these partners are running out of jobs and they are looking for these AI transformations.(...) My goal is I know that I cannot scale myself to be able to do these simulations myself. I'm recording the videos, training the partners to be able to do this for this business to scale. Otherwise, if I do the workshops myself or the simulations, it will not scale. But in the beginning as a solo entrepreneur, I understand that I need to sell, build and do all these bits and pieces myself. But at the end, I want to be able to give it to the partners so the partner can sell, can charge and can collect the money. And I can only focus on the customer creation, not on the borrowing or the sales cycle just alone, but turn all the business. And I also saw this in Goldman Sachs, the model that I mentioned for 300,000 pounds three years ago on AI agents. I got that model from there. But the problem is, as you said, I'm only one person. I have to feed a family, XYZ, I'm doing many things at the same time. But this is kind of a lifestyle business for me. I want to be able to travel the world while the companies are paying my expenses. That is, I don't want to pay for, I don't like paying for stuff. I like the enterprises(...) paying for what I do. So that is the business model that I created over the years as a contractor. And this is effectively selling my own contract. Even though there's a business, there could be a scale in the future. I want to be in the business because I like it. I like dealing with people. I like rejections. I like companies. I like the dramas. It's like a big play for me. Dag, I want to give you a little bit more information about why we want to define what to talk about. And we are talking about your business and about

I will make sure I go through them, I sign them up, I make sure that I install the program, so their assessments are preparing them for the simulations. Because once they come to the simulations, I'm doing the simulation on Kamba, on a infinite whiteboard. They should be able to use it. So the business model starts with an assessment. It goes to a simulation, but for them to be able to come to the assessment, my funnel is the YouTube channel or the LinkedIn that diverts some directly over there. Yeah, going into details, I know that you did a lot of pivoting in your business, Johnny. My life is only a pivot, a big pivot.

(...)

Because I'm an immigrant, I will start speaking French if I need to.

(...)

Yes, it's true. I mean that your main goal is on the top of the big, big mountain.(...) No, not the big mountain. There is only money left there.(...) I don't want to go and work for NATO. The Putin is bombing Ukraine. I need to go and work for NATO. There is no jobs left. That is the reality in the world. I don't want to go and work in reading in the government. Only the electricity operator is left in the country. There is no other jobs left.(...) That's why, because you guys need electricity.

(...)

Okay, this is a nice picture. Theoretically, you are talking really right things, but there is also a reality.(...) And naturally, it's very hard, but unbelievably complicated to jump from the bottom of the mountains to the top.

(...)

Maybe we can create a smaller steps of going there,

(...)

and to go iteratively,(...) and then we can get there sooner, definitely sooner, than to do one jump. We cannot be ready to do one jump, because even the big enterprises, they are not ready to talk to you because you are one.

(...)

Yes, yes, I agree. The enterprise... They can do...

your goals and about your customers because our platform aims to be sort of your business partner who is promoting you, who is feeding our main clients with useful information and at the same time promoting you and giving you potential clients. By the way, Alden,(...) I've seen this "You are your ex-lady" that she had first video with us.

(...)

Do you mean Lauren? Lauren, yeah. And Lauren got a big client. That's why she's too busy. I mean, it gives something, it gives credibility.(...) Your presence and being watched by different people, companies, and having views not on your own platform, on others' platform, gives you an additional credibility.(...) And if you can leverage a little bit smaller businesses that you can help with and they can pay for it, I think that this way can bring more money sooner for you than this long way to get a big, big enterprise. Yes, that is in my business plan. Finding partners is part of my business plan. In the weekend that I sold, I did not sell it myself. The partner sold it. With the platform that we have, because what I'm signing up for is, I'm saying there will be 10 times more jobs of training these robots, building those robots, and managing them. There will be 10 times new, unknown jobs. I'm okay to build them for the people, those jobs, and I need a partner to sell the idea and to make sure that they can borrow the people's time. So I need the partners. And the partners are small businesses, not big enterprises. Big enterprises are just customers that are ready to pay because they are very pragmatistic. The company that I work for right now spends 100 million pounds on a migration project.

They are like the big money balls. Yes, but still partners are small businesses. You know, the big companies will even big companies have more money. They are already struggling with turning into AI world because they are much less flexible than small companies. That's why small business is growing rapidly. That's why startups are growing and big businesses, they like a big bear that is heavy. They are heavy. They have processes. It takes time. They have lots of people. They need to teach them. They have to change their mindset. It's a very huge and long term. And that's why they are becoming less competitive and the world is changing. Yes, this comes to the Alden's question before we end up. Do I charge the prosumers, the professionals and the workshops? As I said, they are free on the YouTube. Why they are free? Because I want to at the end of today, turn those prosumers into partners that are going to sell themselves to the enterprises, which will unlock the enterprise sales. So this is my whole game plan. Get somebody into that enterprise that already got assessed, that already went through simulation. That understands there's a new agent coming on and make us. You know what?(...) Yeah, you know what, Alden, I'm sure that Adam has a hundred of different small AI products in his system.

(...)

You are them. You definitely, you already have AI agents, lots of them, and relate to different things.

(...)

And is it possible to pack one of things you've already created and to show it and to give it even for a small fee that can cover something? No, we can give them for free and we can do the workshop and the simulation for free. For the small businesses, I want to be able to convert them to a partner.

in it and started cleaning up. Who is going to support it? Do you want somebody in Cambridge to support that robot or somebody in China? Most of the time people want somebody that is close by. If that robot does not work, you want that fixing person as close as possible. Right now we are not living in that world. It could be too futuristic for you guys, but an agent and a robot. Once it does not work, you need a human to fix it. And most of the jobs that this new AI robotic world is going to become fixing these robots jobs.(...) Most of the time people think that robots are going to fix themselves. That is not going to happen. The humans are living in the real world. We will go and fix those robots and make them useful.(...) This is our job. That job is not going to go away.

(...)

So where does that leave us?(...) So we've all agreed that we like the idea of doing a value link pro chat about AI, agentic systems, and I think particularly about how they can be useful to small businesses.(...) And that gives us a great way of saying, oh, and go and check out these self-assessment tools, go and check out which hopefully will draw business towards

(...)

the prosumers that you're trying to reach.(...) So I think that's our first step, isn't it?

(...)

I think that is the main goal. Focusing on enterprises is way too in the future. Let's just focus on assessments and on the free workshops that they can come in and say, okay, I assessed myself. I don't know what I need to do, but at least they have some kind of a roadmap. They can come and join. And if they get a value out of it, I will get a value out of it because I'm collecting feedback. They get a value out of it. Somebody is holding their hand. So everybody's happy. If they really like it and they see this agentic future for themselves, once they get planted into an enterprise, they can say, okay, we did this delivery pilot thing. Why are we?

long run. I'm not expecting them to be able to charge it because my enterprise business model is I sell the enterprise agents and they ask me to maintain it and I will charge them on a recurring basis. I don't want to charge lots of small businesses on a small amount of money and focus on them but turn them into a salesperson in the long run. Make them a partner so I can sell a consistent revenue for the companies who has lots of age robots meaning such as Tesla will have one million robots. I will rather sell it to Tesla than sell it to a small business. That's my way of looking at it but I still need somebody who is going to create that new job such as the new job is being a policeman in a road go to a 1000 go to 100 years ago you need a person who will do the signaling. I'm going to create the signaling job then there is going to be a light posture then there's going to be an electronic signaling job there's all these new jobs are going to get created it will always reiterate so I always need the people. YouTube is a good platform to reach out to professionals and to the consumer audience but at the end of today I want to be able to go to the enterprises but the partners are definitely going to come from your network the value link network who are small businesses who are lost who don't know what to do in this AI based world. I promise I'm going to give them a job that's my main promise.(...) They are way to be promoted to the next level because they will give you credibility they will increase your credibility significantly. Not my credibility but what I'm trying to do with the partners is I'm trying to make sure they own this product and sell these agents as theirs as much as possible not as my products actually because this is sold in Asia I'm doing this in Asia the guy thinks he's going to get the support from it such as think about it Mariana Alden you get a robot in your house started walking

in agile. Let's do this in a robotic, agentic way instead of doing it in the old shoulder tapping way of agile. Let's move to that kind of level.

(...)

So in terms of structure, then we should arrange date for a call.(...) I'll send you an email. The way that I normally do it is you send me the five bullet points or so that we'll talk about my call and then I'll ask the questions to draw out all of that.(...) I think particularly for this chat, it'll be quite nice to have you explaining a point where I put some visuals up next to it. So there's something kind of to relate the content or to land through it. Particularly if you've got screenshots of using an AI or like any images that illustrate it, send it through to me. And then when I edit the video, I can put it up alongside. And I think that will make it much easier for the audience to follow the content.(...) And we can also put up links to your website, links to where they can go for this assessment process.

(...)

We'll host up on our platform once we've built it, but we're not there yet.

(...)

All right. That's fine.(...) I can. I'm right now recording this call. I will extract this call, get five of those points and send you the visuals at the same time. Hopefully the agent is listening right now. It's a little to the job and I will send it. I will already send one to Mariana before this call started a PDF and what we are going to talk, but you guys changed the format and I pivoted and I will pivot to this one. Just for my personal interest, can you send me the five bullet points from the agenda summary of what you should talk about? And then your five points after you've edited them, I'll be quite keen to see what the difference is.(...) All right. What is the difference between yours and mine? Five points. No, no, no. So you'll get you've got an AI that is going to go over the summary of this call and it will propose five bullet points for you to talk about, right? Yes.

(...)

And I'd imagine that you'll look at those five bullet points and you'll go, well, yes, but not this one quite. I want to tweak it a little bit.(...) Yes, no, but I'm sure it's the seabird.

Hopefully you use it.

(...)

Thank you, yes, I'd like to have a look. All right, take care then, thank you very much for the time. I will see you guys on the night.

(...)

Yes, see you on the night. Odin, not me, I will not take part in that. You will both talk. I will see you on the night and enjoy the winter break. But between this time you will exchange emails, right? Yes, absolutely. Yes, I will send a transcript on those five bullet points, then we will exchange emails, I guess. Perfect. Thanks, have a nice day. Bye.

or announced?(...) Yes, what I do all the ness because I'm in this video production for the last five years, how AI agents changed my video production is, I'm an irrational person like number PI, unable to stop, unable to stop writing, unable to stop shooting. Once I started using the AI, I learned to pivot to the AI. Right now, AI is writing the script. I am saying what the AI is telling me to say. I'm changing my idea instead of AI changing my idea. Do you understand what I'm doing? Once I do that though, because these large language models and the AI is very rational and our call is going to be 15 minutes, it's not infinite and it's not irrational. It really helps coming up and I do update it and I keep on pivoting. As Mariana said, I will be pivoting with the AI. I will give you the output and make sure if you update it, I will pivot on what you are doing though. I will not object to you. I lost too much time. I'm at the age of 45. I will dance with you. (Laughs)(...) Well, it's always, I think the interviews are most effective when there's a natural flow to the conversation anyway. So it's always been my skill to try and stick to the bullet points, but also to lead the conversation in a nice intuitive way so it all comes together. We'll see how it goes. Yes. Did you plan the date?(...) No. We haven't had a date. We should set a date. You guys can give me the date. Fridays are good for me though. I'm traveling on Tuesday, Wednesdays and Thursdays. I can either do weekends,(...) Monday, Friday.(...) I can do those dates. One thing that I learned Alden, I did TV shows as well. In the TV podcasts, sometimes what the presenter does is, they don't go over the subject not to lose the energy in the interview.(...) That's also one of the things that you should consider. Like you can have a structured bullet points, but also leave some gap for unknowns. So it keeps people alive. Otherwise, it's very, very easy.

to become a bit robotic in these calls? Yeah, I don't do that. I always have the notes to the side and I'm keeping them in my head, but I'm always focused on the flow of the conversation. I'm not trying to fit it too tightly to a structure, because as you say, it becomes robotic and then it loses a lot of its interest. You need to go with the flow of it. Yeah, absolutely.

(...)

So what about Friday the 9th of January? Would that work for you? Yeah, perfect.

(...)

Okay, cool. And let's book in for something like 2.30 in the afternoon. And 12.

(...)

I can't do it at 12 because this is my lunch break. I'm doing it in the lunch break. No problem. 12 is fine.

(...)

All right. Then when?

(...)

Friday the 9th, 12 noon.

(...)

Okay.(...) All right.(...) Okay. Okay. Very good. Brilliant. And let's from time to time, either online or offline, we can go over our video production, pre-prod-prod. Let's create a community in Cambridge and let's get better at this video production. And I see you guys getting better. I see you guys getting better. I want you guys to get better because if you guys get better, I will get better. I will try to help you guys as much as possible. For today's call, the main problem is the head.(...) My head,(...) Alden's head and the Mariana's head and positioning are not at the same level. This is going to create a cringe. So what needs to happen is either I go small, I go small like this. I transition to here. I will become small, but then I'm not matching up Alden. So we need to be at a similar height. That's the main feedback.

(...)

Yes.(...) I mostly do the calls as Zoom calls where and I set up my recording so that I've got two video feeds that are both the same side and next to each other. And then the thing that's quite nice about the script is that you can set up kind of pre-generated layouts. And I just go, OK, for this little bit of conversation, I want this layout.

and it'll zoom into one particular bit of the video in your face and then put some captions underneath it. So it makes it very quick to switch between different... I did like that on Descript. I watched the videos. On the initial ones you guys were unable to manage the timing on the cognitive load. Right now they are a bit slower, a bit better, because they were changing way too fast. Right now they are a bit better, but still consider them. Slowing down, not slowing down, slowing up is not important, but the cognitive load is important. I know it takes too much time to rewatch it, to understand it, to go over it. I do it with Coursera. Their main keyword is the cognitive load. How much time we were taking and how fast the stuff is moving is very, very important.

(...)

The balance that I'm always trying to find is hiding cuts.

(...)

So you'll have a flow of like 20 minutes of conversation and you'll have a bunch in it which is not interesting or doesn't go nicely over as a lot of repeats. So I want to cut from here to here and if I can change the layout while I'm doing it, you don't even notice the cut.(...) Whereas if you continue the same layout across the whole thing, including the cut, there's always respect where somebody jumps from there to there.(...) And I'm always targeting authenticity in the flow, which means when it obviously judders and jumps around while somebody is talking, I feel that that makes the content a little bit less convincing.

(...)

All right. I don't know the answer to the balance behind it. Maybe for you, I will send you links, Alden, on the video production agents I created. It could definitely help you out. What that means is such as you are creating this post-production plan. It creates your post-production plan, a pre-production plan and a production plan with these agents. They do help me a lot and they can also help you a lot as well.

(...)

I'd be keen to have a look. Yeah, definitely share them to you. If it's interesting, use it. Everybody is using the AI agents.
