## 1. Customer Development Model Analysis

### 1.1 Problem-Solution Fit

#### The RAISE Problem (Primary Hypothesis)
**Premise**: AI technology evolves faster than workforce skills can adapt, creating a critical delivery gap in enterprises.

**Critical Examination**:
- ✅ **VALID**: Industry data supports rapid AI evolution (ChatGPT reaching 100M users in 2 months, unprecedented technology adoption rates)
- ✅ **VALID**: Skills gap is documented across enterprises (LinkedIn Learning reports 92% of executives cite skills gaps)
- ⚠️ **CAUTION**: The term "RAISE" is not industry-standard; may need explanation/education in sales cycles
- ✅ **STRONG**: The gap between "vibe programming" (non-deterministic AI) and traditional deterministic development is real and growing

**Conclusion**: The problem hypothesis is fundamentally sound and addresses a genuine, urgent market need.

### 1.2 Target Customer Segments

#### Primary Segments Identified:
1. **Prosumers** ($50/session)
   - Individual professionals seeking AI skills assessment
   - Career-focused individuals wanting to stay competitive
   - **Premise**: Professionals will pay for 1-on-1 assessment
   - **Critical Thinking**: Low price point ($50) may attract tire-kickers; qualification process needed

2. **Enterprise Teams** (£500/day workshops)
   - Medium to large enterprises (50+ employees)
   - Organizations with existing tech teams
   - Companies undergoing digital transformation
   - **Premise**: Enterprises value face-to-face training at £500/consultant/day

### 8.3 Biggest Risks to Business Viability

**Risk #1: Time-for-Money Trap**
Without recurring revenue or scalable delivery, the founder is trading time for money. This is a consulting lifestyle, not a scalable business. **This is the single biggest threat to long-term success.**

**Risk #2: Credibility Mismatch**
If the market perceives Delivery Pilot as a "DevOps consultant trying to do AI," credibility suffers. AI-specific case studies and credentials must be prioritized immediately.

**Risk #3: Market Education Burden**

### 8.4 Biggest Opportunities for Growth

**Opportunity #1: SaaS Pivot**
Converting the assessment tool + workshops into a subscription platform could 10x the business value and create an asset that's sellable.

**Opportunity #2: Financial Services Niche**
Doubling down on FinTech/banking could position Delivery Pilot as *the* AI transformation partner for regulated industries.

**Opportunity #3: Partnership with Cloud Vendors**
Microsoft/AWS partnerships could provide co-marketing, credibility, and access to enterprise customers actively seeking AI enablement.

### 8.5 Go/No-Go Assessment

**Question**: Should this business continue in its current form?

**Answer**: **Conditional GO** with immediate pivots required.

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Market need is real and urgent
- ✅ Founder has relevant expertise
- ✅ Initial product is market-ready
- ⚠️ Current model is not scalable
- ⚠️ Risks outweigh opportunities without changes
- ⚠️ 6-12 month runway to prove recurring revenue model

**Recommendation**: 
1. Execute Priority 1 & 2 recommendations within 90 days (recurring revenue + scale beyond founder)
2. If successful, proceed with expansion plans
3. If not successful, consider acqui-hire or pivot to SaaS platform with investor backing

## 10. Critical Thinking Summary

This analysis has employed several critical thinking frameworks:

### 10.1 Premises Examined
1. ✅ RAISE is a real problem
2. ⚠️ RAISE terminology will resonate (unproven)
3. ✅ Pricing is competitive
4. ⚠️ 3-stage model creates lock-in (weak without incentives)
5. ⚠️ DevOps expertise transfers to AI credibility (partial)

### 10.2 Logical Fallacies Identified
1. **Appeal to Authority**: Past employers ≠ AI expertise
2. **Hasty Generalization**: 50 customers across all services ≠ 50 AI customers
3. **Sunk Cost**: Continuing proprietary terminology without market validation

### 10.3 Cognitive Biases Considered
1. **Overconfidence**: Attempting to teach 10 AI topics alone
2. **Confirmation Bias**: Seeing success stories without AI specifics as validation
3. **Planning Fallacy**: Underestimating complexity of scaling

### 10.4 Questions Left Unanswered
1. What is the actual conversion rate from prosumer to workshop?
2. What is the customer lifetime value?
3. Why would a customer choose Delivery Pilot over Coursera + freelance consultant?
4. How many enterprises can realistically be served simultaneously by founder?
5. What happens if the founder gets sick/burned out?
