## Solving the RAISE Problem in Enterprise AI Transformation

**Presenter**: Rifat Erdem Sahin, Founder & CEO, Delivery Pilot
**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Date**: December 2024

## Introduction (2 minutes)

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
"Imagine you're running a Fortune 500 company. Last year, your developers were experts. Today? They're struggling. Not because they're bad developers, but because AI has changed the game overnight. This is what I call the RAISE Problem: Rapid AI Increases Skills Expectations. And it's costing enterprises millions."

### Who I Am (1 minute)
"I'm Rifat Erdem Sahin, founder of Delivery Pilot. I've spent over 15 years with companies like Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, and IBM. I'm UK SC Cleared, NATO Cleared, and maintain over 200 GitHub repositories - in the top 1% of GitHub contributors globally. But more importantly, I've seen firsthand how enterprises struggle when technology moves faster than their teams can adapt."

### What We're Covering Today (30 seconds)
"In the next 13 minutes, I'll share:
1. The RAISE Problem that's keeping CTOs up at night
2. Why traditional training fails in the AI era
3. How we're helping enterprises bridge this gap
4. Real results from companies who've transformed their teams
5. What you can do starting today"

## Part 1: The Problem - Understanding RAISE (3 minutes)

### The Speed Mismatch (1 minute)
"Let me paint a picture. ChatGPT reached 100 million users in 2 months. For context, it took Instagram 2.5 years to hit that milestone. AI isn't just evolving fast - it's accelerating exponentially. Meanwhile, traditional corporate training cycles run 6-12 months. See the problem?"

### The Non-Deterministic Shift (1 minute)
"Here's what's really challenging: we've moved from deterministic programming to what I call 'vibe programming.' In traditional software, if you input X, you get Y - every single time. With AI? You might get Y, or something close to Y, or something completely unexpected. Your teams need to learn an entirely new way of thinking, not just new tools."

### The Real Cost (1 minute)
"LinkedIn Learning reports that 92% of executives cite skills gaps as their top concern. But here's what that really means:
- Projects delayed by 6-12 months
- Failed AI initiatives costing millions
- Teams feeling overwhelmed and disengaged
- Competitive disadvantage as AI-native companies move faster
- Security vulnerabilities because teams don't understand AI risks"

---

## Part 2: Why Traditional Solutions Fail (2 minutes)

### The Theory Trap (45 seconds)
"Most training platforms teach theory. You watch videos, take quizzes, get certificates. But when you sit down to actually implement AI in your enterprise environment - with your security requirements, your compliance needs, your legacy systems - you're lost. There's a massive gap between knowing and doing."

### The Consulting Conundrum (45 seconds)
"Big consulting firms will charge you millions for an 18-month transformation. They'll create beautiful PowerPoint decks. But 6 months in, you realize you're no closer to actually having AI capabilities. Why? Because they're optimized for selling hours, not delivering outcomes."

### The Scale Problem (30 seconds)
"And if you try to train teams yourself? You're looking at inconsistent quality, massive time investment, and by the time everyone's trained, the technology has evolved again. It's a hamster wheel."

## Part 3: The Delivery Pilot Solution (4 minutes)

### Our Three-Stage Transformation Model (1 minute)
"We've developed a practical, implementation-focused approach with three stages:

**Stage 1: Assess** - We start with a comprehensive 48-question AI readiness assessment. Not generic questions, but deep dives into your team's actual capabilities, your infrastructure, your security posture. Within hours, you know exactly where you stand.

**Stage 2: Train** - Hands-on workshops, £500 per consultant per day. But here's the difference: you walk away with Git-based deliverables. Working code. Actual implementations. Not theory.

**Stage 3: Implement** - We stay with you through deployment. Real AI solutions in your environment, meeting your compliance requirements, integrated with your systems."

### What Makes Us Different (1.5 minutes)
"Three key differentiators:

**First**: We're implementation-obsessed. Every workshop produces Git repositories with working code. You can deploy it the next day. This isn't theory - it's practical, battle-tested solutions.

**Second**: We focus on the top 10 AI areas that actually matter:
- Vibe programming and non-deterministic development
- Explainable AI - so you understand what your AI is doing
- ChatGPT and conversational AI
- Prompt engineering
- Vector databases and RAG
- Fine-tuning large language models
- AI security and ethics
- GDPR compliance

We don't waste time on buzzwords. We focus on what you need to compete.

**Third**: Scalability through our partner network. We're not trying to be everywhere ourselves. We're building a network of certified partners who can deliver our methodology globally. This means you get expertise when you need it, where you need it, without the typical consulting firm overhead."

### The Founder-Led Approach (1 minute)
"Here's something unique: we're building this through personal brand and thought leadership. I publish weekly on YouTube, sharing real AI transformation insights, DevOps tutorials, enterprise demonstrations. Why? Because trust matters. When you're betting your company's future on AI transformation, you want to work with someone who actually understands the technology, not just sells it.

Our goal is 10,000 YouTube subscribers in 12 months, and we're building a community of practitioners, not just customers."

### Pricing Transparency (30 seconds)
"We believe in transparent pricing:
- $50 for individual AI readiness assessments
- £500 per consultant per day for workshops
- Custom pricing for enterprise transformation programs, typically starting at £25,000

No hidden fees. No scope creep. Fixed deliverables."

## Part 4: Real Results (2 minutes)

### Case Study Snapshot (1 minute)
"Let me share a quick example. A mid-size financial services company came to us. Their development team of 50 was struggling with AI adoption. Security concerns. Compliance worries. Projects stalled.

We ran our assessment, identified the gaps, delivered 5 days of workshops. Three months later:
- They deployed their first production AI feature
- Team confidence scores up 300%
- Two major AI projects moved from stalled to shipped
- Most importantly: they now have the capability to continue evolving independently"

### The Broader Impact (1 minute)
"We've now worked with over 50 enterprise customers. What we see consistently:
- 40% reduction in AI project cycle time
- 85% implementation success rate
- Teams actually excited about AI instead of overwhelmed
- Enterprises moving from AI-curious to AI-capable in 90 days instead of 18 months

The secret? We're not selling transformation. We're selling capability. We're giving your teams the skills and tools to transform themselves."

## Part 5: Call to Action & Next Steps (2 minutes)

### For Individuals (30 seconds)
"If you're a professional wondering about your AI readiness, start with our $50 assessment at deliverypilot.net. In one session, you'll know exactly where you stand and what skills you need to develop. It's the best $50 investment in your career you'll make this year."

### For Teams (30 seconds)
"If you're leading a team, let's talk about our workshop program. Five days, tangible outputs, real skills. Visit our website, check out the workshops page, or contact us directly. We'll start with a free consultation to understand your needs."

### For Partners (30 seconds)
"And if you're a consultant or training organization looking to add AI transformation to your offerings, we're building our partner network. We provide comprehensive training, materials, support. Let's talk about how we can work together."

### The Urgency Factor (30 seconds)
"Here's my final thought: the AI skills gap isn't getting smaller. Every month you wait is another month your competitors are pulling ahead. But the good news? With the right approach, you can close this gap in 90 days. Not 18 months. Not years. 90 days from assessment to capability.

The question isn't whether you'll transform. It's whether you'll do it before or after your competition."

## Podcast Host Discussion Points (Optional - for Q&A segment)

### Potential Follow-Up Questions:
1. **"What's the biggest misconception about AI transformation?"**
   - "That it's about technology. It's actually about people. The technology is ready. The question is whether your team is ready to use it effectively."

2. **"How do you stay current with AI moving so fast?"**
   - "Continuous learning is built into our DNA. We maintain top 1% GitHub presence, we're actively implementing, and we have a network of practitioners sharing knowledge. We're not theorists - we're practitioners."

3. **"What advice for CTOs listening right now?"**
   - "Start with assessment, not implementation. You can't fix what you can't measure. Understand your current state, then build a practical 90-day roadmap. And focus on capability building, not just project delivery."

4. **"What's next for Delivery Pilot?"**
   - "Three things: First, scaling our partner network to 25+ partners by year two. Second, launching a subscription model for continuous learning. Third, expanding geographically, starting with deeper penetration in the UK and Turkey markets. But always with the same focus: practical, implementation-focused transformation."

5. **"Biggest challenge you've faced?"**
   - "Market education. The RAISE acronym isn't standard yet, so we have to explain the concept. But that's also our opportunity - we're defining the category. We're not just solving a problem, we're naming it."
